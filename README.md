### Hullo ðŸ¤©

My name is Gabby and this year I completed my Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering! I don't know what I'm doing with my life right now, but I am having fun coding, so look forward to seeing more projects from me! :-)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [personal website](https://gabbyagustin.me) as well as upgrading it by adding my [nail shop](https://shop.gabbyagustin.me) My most recent completed project is my [engineering capstone project](https://github.com/Eebzie/wireless-prosthetic-arm)
